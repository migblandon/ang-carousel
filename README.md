<h1>Carousel</h1>
<h3>Adjustable image slider with small click buttons on top</h3>
This AngularJs module simply adds a lightweight module to your project to view a slide show of images.
You can adjust the time to start, an example could be 6 seconds and then after, images change every 4 seconds (easy adjustable).
Add your own images to the folder images or any other folder and edit the model of images to show yours.
